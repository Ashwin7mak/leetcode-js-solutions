# Two Sum Less Than K

Given an array A of integers and integer K, return the maximum S such that there exists i < j with A[i] + A[j] = S and S < K. If no i, j exist satisfying this equation, return -1.

 Example 1:

Input: A = [34,23,1,24,75,33,54,8], K = 60
Output: 58
Explanation: 
We can use 34 and 24 to sum 58 which is less than 60.
Example 2:

Input: A = [10,20,30], K = 15
Output: -1
Explanation: 
In this case it's not possible to get a pair sum less that 15.
