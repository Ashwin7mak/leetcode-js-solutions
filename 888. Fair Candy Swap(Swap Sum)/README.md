# Swap Sum

Given two arrays of integers, find a pair of values (one from each array) that you can swap to give the two arrays the same sum.

Example 1:

Input: A = [1,1], B = [2,2]
Output: [1,2]
Example 2:

Input: A = [1,2], B = [2,3]
Output: [1,2]
Example 3:

Input: A = [2], B = [1,3]
Output: [2,3]
Example 4:

Input: A = [1,2,5], B = [2,4]
Output: [5,4]
 

Note:

1 <= A.length <= 10000
1 <= B.length <= 10000
1 <= A[i] <= 100000
1 <= B[i] <= 100000
