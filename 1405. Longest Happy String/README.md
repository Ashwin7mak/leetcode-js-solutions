# Longest Happy String

A string is called happy if it does not have any of the strings 'aaa', 'bbb' or 'ccc' as a substring.

Given three integers a, b and c, return any string s, which satisfies following conditions:

s is happy and longest possible.
s contains at most a occurrences of the letter 'a', at most b occurrences of the letter 'b' and at most c occurrences of the letter 'c'.
s will only contain 'a', 'b' and 'c' letters.
If there is no such string s return the empty string "".

 

Example 1:
Input: a = 1, b = 1, c = 7
Output: "ccaccbcc"
Explanation: "ccbccacc" would also be a correct answer.

Example 2:
Input: a = 2, b = 2, c = 1
Output: "aabbc"

Example 3:
Input: a = 7, b = 1, c = 0
Output: "aabaa"
Explanation: It's the only correct answer in this case.
 
Constraints:

0 <= a, b, c <= 100
a + b + c > 0
